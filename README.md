## Description: 
This app is meant to help users make the most out of leftover foods or ingredients that may be stuck lying around 
in their fridge or pantry. The user simply adds their ingredients to the page, one at a time, and then presses
"Search Ingredients". The page will then display a recipe that includes the ingredients they searched for, and lists pertinent
information, such as the complete list of ingredients used to make the recipe, total time it takes to prepare, calories, and more.
If the user is feeling uninspired or just wants to try something new, they can press the "Find a random recipe" button
and the app will generate a completely random recipe. On larger screens, the recipe information is displayed in a separate window 
that automatically scrolls down the page to display its information. To return to the search, the user need only press the "Back to Top" 
button. If a user mistypes an ingredient or wants to remove one before searching, they can just press the 'X' to the upper right of the
unwanted ingredient and it will be removed.

## Technology:
This app was built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript/AJAX
